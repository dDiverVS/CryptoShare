# CryptoShare
CryptoShare is a PHP interface which allows easy and secure file sharing over a debian style Linux server. Therefore it uses Linux integrated GPG assimetric cryptography.

Note: The entire software is written by now in spanish, it will be slowly updated to be complete in english. However, if you want a complete spanish version, you can contact me at gabriel dot velez at outlook dot com. Otherwise you may download an alternative version from the spanish branch.
